- Report Card Access: Allow students to view and download their report cards for each semester/term.
- Leave Application: Enable students to apply for leave by specifying dates, reasons, and uploading supporting documents.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#4285F4) to convey trustworthiness and intelligence.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a desaturated shade of the primary, to maintain a light and airy feel.
- Accent color: Sunny yellow (#FFEB3B) to draw attention to calls to action and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that provides a modern and friendly feel suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons with rounded corners to represent different sections and actions. Icons should be in the primary blue color.
- Implement a card-based layout for a clean, organized, and easy-to-navigate dashboard. Each feature should have its dedicated card.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and feedback, like a loading animation on fee payment or a confirmation animation on leave application.
- The option to fees, homework, feedback, report card, etc should show in gridview in card form
