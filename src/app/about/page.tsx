                    Hey, Iâ€™m Lucky Chawla! Iâ€™m a Class XII coder and AI enthusiast, and the developer behind the all-new Hilton Convent School website. At 16, I rebuilt the entire site from scratch because the old one was buggy, lacked basic features, and crashed constantly. This project is the result of days and nights of hard work, built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase SQL Database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big shoutout to Priyanka Varshney Maâ€™am, who left the school recentlyâ€”when I entered Class XI, she explained SQL databases so clearly that I was able to implement the entire website using Supabase. Her teachings on DBMS in Class IX and X gave me the foundation to understand complex database structures and bring this site to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also completed my Class X here with 88.4% in the 2023â€“24 session, scoring 96 in IT (Computer). Even after switching my subject from Computer Science to Physical Education in Class XI, I didnâ€™t stopâ€”my passion kept me coding, and thatâ€™s how this website came to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, Iâ€™m chasing bigger dreams: developing Indiaâ€™s own OS and AI solutions.
